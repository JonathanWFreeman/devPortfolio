## Purpose and Goal

After reading about Gatsby I thought that was the perfect framework for building out a small portfolio site, and it would allow me to learn something new in the process. One thing I really wanted to add into the site were page transitions. I had not used an animation framework before and decided on [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for this project after hearing Scott Tolinski speak highly of it in an episode of the Syntax podcast. I also thought this would be a great opportunity to learn styled components as well, which it turns out I love!

Another addition I made towards the end of the project was adding React Three Fiber and adding 3D models to the home page. Having a background in 3D Animation, I thought this would be fun to do. I created the models in Blender and have them cycling in a loop along with a constant rotation.
